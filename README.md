# 💰 Personal IPO Calculator

A web application that calculates your "market value" as if you were going public on the stock exchange. Enter your personal and professional details to discover your fair market valuation, share price, and dividend potential.

## 🎯 About This Project

I created this calculator to accompany my new article on [personal IPOs](https://nodumbideas.com/p/the-big-idea-a-personal-ipo)
. The app finds your market value based on discounted future cash flows from dividends - human capital is full of value investors.

## 🚀 Features

- **Market Valuation**: Calculate your total market cap based on expected lifetime dividend payments
- **Share Price**: Determine your per-share price (assuming 1M shares outstanding)  
- **Risk Assessment**: Get personalized investment warnings based on your profile
- **Social Sharing**: Share your IPO results on social media
- **Image Export**: Download high-quality PNG images 

## 🛠️ Technology

This is a single-file HTML application with embedded CSS and JavaScript - no build process required. Key technologies:

- **Vanilla JavaScript** for calculations and interactions
- **html2canvas** for generating downloadable images
- **Modern CSS** with gradients, animations, and responsive design

## 📊 How It Works

The calculator uses a dividend discount model to determine valuation:

1. Calculates present value of expected dividend payments until retirement (age 65)
2. Applies education and industry multipliers for risk assessment
3. Generates personalized investment warnings based on your profile
4. Creates shareable results with your custom ticker symbol

## 🎨 Built with AI

I used AI (Claude) extensively throughout the development process to:
- Help implement the financial calculations
- Debug JavaScript issues
- Improve the user interface
- Generate the risk warning system
- Optimize image generation functionality

This is my first Github project, but hopefully not my last
